So awhile back I got a bit bored in a class and decided to quickly play around with the HTML5 ``canvas`` and make somthing with it. I thought "Hey, why not put a bunch of stale memes on the canvas?" Eventually I used to project to play around with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com "Firebase") and that gave birth to a multiplayer version called [MEMEPAINT With Friends](https://nalcad.tk/MEMEPAINT/mwf "MEMEPAINT With Friends").

## Internals

MEMEPAINT is writen in the stuff that runs in your browser, namley HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It's pretty simple and I was working on it back when my programming skills were slightly less developed.
